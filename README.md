# The 2023 Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour

This is a repo of code for the third and final assignments for the Advanced GIS: Interactive Web Mapping and Spatial Data Visualization course at NYU Wagner, Spring 2024.

A dataset was generated using Wikipedia data for the [2023 Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_World_Tour) [see: Tour Dates section]. 
In total, 39 unique venues were identified for a total of 56 tour dates.

A color key was generated based off of total nights performed at a given venue, but the original idea was to have the key based off whether the 'Big Three' ( “Drunk in Love,” “Thique,” and “All Up In Your Mind”) were performed or not. Beyoncé only performed them at a handful of shows, including Atlanta, Houston, and Los Angeles.
A reputable source could not be located to determine the venues these songs were performed at, so the idea was scrapped.

In full, a base map was generated. Two images of silver and gold disco balls (which symbolize the theme of the Beyoncé Renaissance era) were uploaded and given conditions for when to appear as markers. A popup was set up to relay venue and revenue statistics when the disco markers are clicked. And a button was added so tour locations by continent could be easily jumped to when clicked.
