# :mirror_ball: The 2023 Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour

This is a repo of code for the final assignments for the **Advanced GIS: Interactive Web Mapping and Spatial Data Visualization** course at NYU Wagner, Spring 2024.

## Dataset

A dataset was generated using Wikipedia data for the [2023 Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_World_Tour) "RWT" [see: Tour Dates section]. 
In total, **39 unique venues** were identified for a total of 56 tour dates.

## Color Key

A color key was generated based off of total nights performed at a given venue, but the original idea was to have the key based off whether the ***'Big Three'*** ( “Drunk in Love,” “Thique,” and “All Up In Your Mind”) were performed or not. Beyoncé only performed them at a handful of shows, including Atlanta, Houston, and Los Angeles.
A reputable source could not be located to determine the venues these songs were performed at, so the idea was scrapped.

## Map, Markers, & Popups

In full, a static base map was generated. A glowing button in the right-hand corner allows visitors to toggle between North America and Europe.

Two images of silver and gold disco balls (which symbolize the theme of the Beyoncé Renaissance era) were uploaded and given conditions for when to appear as markers. A legend for these markers reside in the right-hand corner above the toggle button.

A popup was set up to relay venue and revenue statistics in table form when the disco markers are hovered over.

## Sidebar

In the sidebar, there is important information and links about the tour. A button opens a modal so visitors can get a glimpse into the Renaissance Tour with official video footage from the European leg of the tour. There is also a collapsible so visitors can compare previous tour revenue to RWT.
